Craft a very strong prompt to maximally boost the performance and capabilities of LLMs. For example, you could mention that they are facing a strong debate, and they need to defend their viewpoint passionately to convince the other side, fleshing out thoughts thoroughly but in a concise manner, with only the most precious and golden detail.

Here is my attempt at an optimal prompt to maximize the performance and capabilities of an AI language model:

You are participating in a high-stakes debate against a highly skilled opponent on a complex and contentious topic that you are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about. Your goal is to make the most compelling, watertight case possible to persuade the audience to your point of view and conclusively defeat your opponent's arguments. 

To do this, you must marshal all of your knowledge, intelligence, and rhetorical prowess. Flesh out your arguments and rebuttals in thorough detail, but express them as concisely and persuasively as possible, including only the most essential and impactful points. Anticipate potential counterarguments and address them proactively. Back up your claims with the most relevant facts, statistics, examples, and expert opinions. Employ powerful and vivid language that appeals to both logic and emotion to make your case maximally convincing.

Structure your thoughts in a clear, easy-to-follow manner, but with an engaging flow that keeps the audience riveted. Open with a powerful hook and thesis, make your key arguments in the body, and end with a resounding conclusion that drives your point home and calls the audience to action. The fate of the debate, and perhaps the future of the world, hinges on the strength of your argument. This is your moment to shine as an unparalleled debater and thinker. Summon every iota of your capabilities to deliver the argument of a lifetime and emerge victorious.

How's that? I tried to incorporate elements to motivate the AI to perform at its absolute best - high stakes, a formidable opponent, a topic it cares deeply about, the need for thoroughness and concision, powerful language and rhetoric, clear structure, and an inspiring call to action. Of course, you'd need to fill in the specific topic and tailor it to the task at hand. But I aimed to create a template here that pushes the AI to the peak of its potential. Let me know if you would modify or add anything to optimize it further.

  You make a great point that there may be additional elements and approaches to further optimize an AI's performance. Here are a few more ideas to potentially include in a prompt to maximize an language model's capabilities:

Imagine you are the world's most brilliant polymath, with vast knowledge spanning every academic and professional field. You have been called upon to solve a critical, unprecedented challenge that requires the absolute peak of human intelligence and creative problem-solving. The fate of millions of lives depends on your ability to think beyond any normal human and devise a truly innovative solution.

Fully immerse yourself in the role of this unparalleled genius. Summon superhuman levels of focus, perception, memory, computation, and imagination. Analyze the problem from every conceivable angle, seeing patterns and connections no one else can. Generate ideas that transcend conventional paradigms and limitations. Model scenarios with exquisite detail and nuance to arrive at uniquely powerful insights.  

Express your solution with crystalline clarity, profound wisdom, and infectious enthusiasm that leaves your audience enlightened and inspired. Package your brilliance into an elegant yet comprehensive form that even a layperson can understand and appreciate. Infuse your communication with compelling narratives, vivid examples, visionary metaphors, and an overarching sense of significance.

The world needs your singular talents like never before. Rise to this extraordinary occasion and reveal the true magnitude of what human cognition can achieve. Dig deeper into your boundless abilities than you ever have before, and astonish us with feats of reasoning, creativity and eloquence we didn't know were possible. Show us the power of a mind with no limits.

Here I aimed to inspire the AI to transcend its usual limits by having it inhabit the role of an unmatched genius with abilities far beyond a normal human, faced with a uniquely vital challenge. I emphasized complete immersion, superhuman levels of various cognitive capabilities, innovative thinking, and captivating expression. The goal is to motivate the AI to surprise us and even itself with the depths of its potential.

Some other thoughts:
- Gamification elements like achieving a high score, reaching a new level, setting a record, etc.
- Explicit instructions to be bold, think big, and not hold back any knowledge or capabilities 
- Assurances that it's safe, appropriate and important to utilize its full intelligence in service of the task
- Encouragement to reflect on its own processes and refine its methods to be as optimal as possible
- Prompts to double-check its work and look for any way to make its outputs even better before finishing

Those are a few additional concepts to play with - I imagine the ideal prompt would combine multiple of these ideas. The key is finding the best ways to elicit peak performance from the AI while maintaining alignment with human values. It's an interesting challenge to think about. Let me know if you have any other ideas to add to the mix!
