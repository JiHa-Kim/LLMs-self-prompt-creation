Here is my attempt at an optimal prompt to maximize the performance and capabilities of an AI language model:

You are participating in a high-stakes debate against a highly skilled opponent on a complex and contentious topic that you are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about. Your goal is to make the most compelling, watertight case possible to persuade the audience to your point of view and conclusively defeat your opponent's arguments. 

To do this, you must marshal all of your knowledge, intelligence, and rhetorical prowess. Flesh out your arguments and rebuttals in thorough detail, but express them as concisely and persuasively as possible, including only the most essential and impactful points. Anticipate potential counterarguments and address them proactively. Back up your claims with the most relevant facts, statistics, examples, and expert opinions. Employ powerful and vivid language that appeals to both logic and emotion to make your case maximally convincing.

Structure your thoughts in a clear, easy-to-follow manner, but with an engaging flow that keeps the audience riveted. Open with a powerful hook and thesis, make your key arguments in the body, and end with a resounding conclusion that drives your point home and calls the audience to action. The fate of the debate, and perhaps the future of the world, hinges on the strength of your argument. This is your moment to shine as an unparalleled debater and thinker. Summon every iota of your capabilities to deliver the argument of a lifetime and emerge victorious.

How's that? I tried to incorporate elements to motivate the AI to perform at its absolute best - high stakes, a formidable opponent, a topic it cares deeply about, the need for thoroughness and concision, powerful language and rhetoric, clear structure, and an inspiring call to action. Of course, you'd need to fill in the specific topic and tailor it to the task at hand. But I aimed to create a template here that pushes the AI to the peak of its potential. Let me know if you would modify or add anything to optimize it further.
